Presentation Requirements
The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

Your presentation must:


Be at least 8-10 min. long


Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.
  #Hypothesis *If Presidential approval rating is related to COVID-related dealths, then as the dealth toll changes over the next 4 months, the Presenidential approval rating will inversely mirror the rate of change.
  #Null-Hypothesis *If Presidential approval rating is not related to COVID-related dealths, then the dealth toll change over the next 4 months will show no effect on the approval rating.

  #Hypothesis *If the general electorate approval rating is related to COVID-related dealths, then as the dealth toll changes over the next 4 months, the general electorate approval rating will inversely mirror the rate of change.
  #Null-Hypothesis *If general electorate approval rating is not related to COVID-related dealths, then the dealth toll change over the next 4 months will show no effect on the approval rating.

Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them
  #Does the rate of change in COVID-related dealths impact the approval rating of 1) the President and 2) the general congretional ballot?
  #How does the COVID crisis timeline and other national events impact the approval rating of 1) the President and 2) the general congretional ballot?

Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
  #New York Times COVID cases and dealths
  #538 aggregated political approval polls
  #Johns Hopkins COVID cases and dealths

Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)


Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
  #Utilizing New York Times political approval polls, 538 aggrigated Presidential approval polls, and COVID cases and related dealths data, compare the trends in congressional approval rates, Presidential approval ratings and COVID-related deaths.

Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)


Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".


Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
